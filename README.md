# Suicide-data-analysis

## Introduction
In this problem, I will be working on Exploratory Data Analysis. Exploratory Data
Analysis (EDA) is an initial investigation to analyze the data. It can be used to discover
trends or patterns in the data. It can also be used to spot anomalies and test
hypotheses. Statistical calculations and graphical visualizations are used in EDA. For
this problem, EDA will be performed on a chosen dataset. I will then present the
information found out using EDA in detail.

## The Dataset:
The dataset I am going to work on is available on Kaggle. It can be viewed on https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016. The
name of the dataset is “Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016”. This dataset gives
information about suicides and suicide rates along with socio-economy information from
1985 to 2016.

## Please check report for detailed analysis.
